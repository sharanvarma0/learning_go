# learning_go
This repo captures my various attempts, failures and programs written in my endless effort to learn and master the Go Programming Language

I shall be documenting all of my attempts at learning go. 
## Graphs
The first start is with Graphs. I have been exploring other Data structures and algorithms for a while now. I am not documenting simple algorithms like
linear/sequential search, binary search or simple sorting techniques like selection sort, insertion sort, heap sort, quick sort. These algorithms are rather
simple and can be implemented in any language.

I shall start with graphs here. The first commit has my attempt at a DFS navigation on a constructed graph. The Code is rather ugly but I shall attempt to improve it in
time.

Enjoy reading through and critiquing. Open to feedback here
